	abstract = {The simulator is an R package that streamlines the process of performing simulations by creating a common infrastructure that can be easily used and reused across projects. Methodological statisticians routinely write simulations to compare their methods to preexisting ones. While developing ideas, there is a temptation to write "quick and dirty" simulations to try out ideas. This approach of rapid prototyping is useful but can sometimes backfire if bugs are introduced. Using the simulator allows one to remove the "dirty" without sacrificing the "quick." Coding is quick because the statistician focuses exclusively on those aspects of the simulation that are specific to the particular paper being written. Code written with the simulator is succinct, highly readable, and easily shared with others. The modular nature of simulations written with the simulator promotes code reusability, which saves time and facilitates reproducibility. The syntax of the simulator leads to simulation code that is easily human-readable. Other benefits of using the simulator include the ability to "step in" to a simulation and change one aspect without having to rerun the entire simulation from scratch, the straightforward integration of parallel computing into simulations, and the ability to rapidly generate plots, tables, and reports with minimal effort.},

It includes tools for (i) running a power analysis for a given model and design; and (ii) calculating power curves to assess trade-offs between power and sample size. This paper presents a tutorial using a simple example of count data with mixed effects (with structure representative of environmental monitoring data) to guide the user along a gentle learning curve, adding only a few commands or options at a time.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs) provide important information about statistical phenomena that would be impossible to assess otherwise. This article introduces MCS methods and their applications to research and statistical pedagogy using a novel software package for the R Project for Statistical Computing constructed to lessen the often steep learning curve when organizing simulation code. A primary goal of this article is to demonstrate how well-suited MCS designs are to classroom demonstrations, and how they provide a hands-on method for students to become acquainted with complex statistical concepts. In this article, essential programming aspects for writing MCS code in R are overviewed, multiple applied examples with relevant code are provided, and the benefits of using a generate–analyze–summarize coding structure over the typical “for-loop” strategy are discussed.},
