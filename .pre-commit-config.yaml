    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix, --exit-zero] # --fix for import sorting and other auto-fixes
        # --exit-zero ensures that pre-commit doesn't fail even if there are linting issues
        # that cannot be auto-fixed, allowing the formatter to run.
        # You might remove --exit-zero if you want linting issues to block commits.
